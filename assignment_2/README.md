Assignment 2 - Sentiment and NER
This code takes the Fake vs Real news data set and splits it into two. Then for every headline of the two data sets, the sentiment scores are retrieved, mentions of geopolitical entities are found and a CSV showing the text ID, the sentiment scores, and column showing all GPEs is saved. 
Finally, the 20 most common geopolitical entities mentioned across each data set is found and the results are plotted as bar charts.
