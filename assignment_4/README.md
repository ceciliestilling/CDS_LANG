## Assignment description
The assignment for this week builds on these concepts and techniques. We're going to be working with the data in the folder CDS-LANG/toxic and trying to see if we can predict whether or not a comment is a certain kind of toxic speech. You should write two scripts which do the following:

The first script should perform benchmark classification using standard machine learning approaches
- This means CountVectorizer() or TfidfVectorizer(), LogisticRegression classifier
- Save the results from the classification report to a text file
The second script should perform classification using the kind of deep learning methods we saw in class
- Keras Embedding layer, Convolutional Neural Network
- Save the classification report to a text file

## Usage
The data 'VideoCommentsThreatCorpus.csv' should be available to the examiner through our professor Ross, but can otherwise be found through this article: https://www.simula.no/sites/default/files/publications/files/cbmi2019_youtube_threat_corpus.pdf
